## &ldquo;IPMS™&rdquo; Mutables Systems

 WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT TRACKING CHANGES

 we need "mutable" blockchains [read more about it](README.html)

### here is the concept (entropic / neg-entropic behavior ):


 1. time goes one direction in the physical world (0 → ∞ )
 2. time goes the other direction in the virtual world (0 → -∞ )

and so goes the hash chains ...


* in the past things are "immutable" and can't change.
* in the present things are totally "random" (aliveness)
* in the future things are predictably "mutable" and will change.

When you consider theses life fundamental principles and do not
goes against universal laws,
it does simplify a lots the system,
and consequently we solved the major issues of today's blockchains

 - consensus
 - efficiency
 - inability to evolve w/o hard fork

The result is a new kind of *block*chain we call [blockRing™][BR]
