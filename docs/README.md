Everything is change, in perpetual transformation
and we try to develop system that are [immutable][IM],
ledger that are permanent !

What wrong with the whole [blockchain industry][BI] ?

[IM]: {{site.search}}=immutable+ledger
[BI]: {{site.search}}=!g+what's+wrong+with+the+blockchain+industry


Out of all the blockchains and ledger technologies around
we are missing a simple one :

 a good way to track changes 


 we need mutable blockchains

 A system what will tell accurately the value of a mutable 
 and this without spending tons of network / computing resources.

 we don't want to "gamble" to have the HEAD block from the chain


We have take a different approach to tackle the problem.

in fact this who as a global society we organize and put our act together to trustfully communicate on the *(inter)*net


A mutable is a "decentalized element" that can be access anywhere with it value maintained by anyone.
it constitutes an "immutable addressing scheme" every one can trust to find data.

A every shared resource it can be "abuse" and the value of a mutable can be "hijacked"
however is we ask everyone to sign their update we have a way to sort our the good records
from the bad.
