Stanford Library's Highwire Press[highwire] led the transition of STM
publishing from paper to the Web and now publishes the on-line editions
of about 180 of the top STM journals. They pioneered techniques such as
datasets in spreadsheets behind graphs, dynamic lists of citing papers,
e-mail notification of citing papers and so on. These, added to the
basic hyperlinks and searchability, make the Web versions both easier
to access and more useful when accessed than the paper ones.
