# testing jekyll ...

Hello World!

 oh I forgot to tell you,
 there is a [README](README.html) file too!

### on the github side

sorry for the silly [github][gh] commits, I am trying to learn
what is the minimal [jekyll][jk] set that will works with both
github and [netlify][nlf] :


[gh]: //github.com/{{ site.ghuser }}
[jk]: {{ site.search }}=jekyll+static+generator+is+cool
[nlf]: https://{{ site.nname }}.netlify.com/


The present, file structure is a docs folder on github
with a README.md **and** an index.htm file
